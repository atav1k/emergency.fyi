				<li cell>
					<h3>Practicing social distancing.</h3>
					<p>This is a strategy to reduce physical interactions between people with the aim of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Practice non-physical greetings, maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and others and cease any form of gatherings.</p>
				</li>
				<li cell>
					<h3>Testing for COVID-19.</h3>
					<p>Symptoms listed are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover from home. Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. If you experience trouble breathing, a persistent pain in the chest, confusion or an inability to arouse or are bluish in your face, get medical attention.</p>
				</li>
				<li cell>
					<h3>Connecting with relief efforts.</h3>
					<p> In addition to governmental response, volunteers across the country are coming together to form mutual aid groups. Seek out or contribute to relief efforts happening in your county. If you can, pay it forward with a financial contribution to local businesses.</p>

					<h3>Indefinite social distancing</h3>
					<p>4 in 5 voters believe we should continue to practice social distancing for as long as necessary. Even if it requires a slower economic recovery.</p>

				</li>		
				<li cell>
					<h3>Emergency preparedness</h3>
					<p>We are facing a massive shortfall of personal protective equipment, ICU beds, ventilators and testing kits. Voters demand that hard hit counties receive additional federal support and where necessary, declare a state of emergency.</p>				
					<h3>{county.governor}</h3>
					<p>(123) 123-1231</p>
				</li>		
				<li cell>
					<h3>Absentee voting.</h3>
					<p> Despite the disruption to civic life America will hold elections this November. Every eligible voter should be able to safely register and vote. Your Secretary of State should bolster absentee voting measures. Contact Secretary of State.</p>
					<h3>{county.secretary}</h3>
					<p>(123) 123-1231</p>
				</li>
				<li cell>
					<h3>Economic relief.</h3>
					<p>The COVID-19 response has necessitated a widespread shutdown of retail and service sectors, threatening millions of lost jobs. Given the quarantine, the government must bail out workers and employers by providing debt relief and emergency subsidies.</p>
					<h3>Contact your Member of Congress.</h3>

			<p>Emergency FYI is calling on Americans to act on this health crisis by supporting our communities, preserving our public health and protecting our democracy. Elected officials can act decisively to:</p>
			<ul class="h3">
				<li>Enforce social distancing and shelter in place so long as is required to keep our communities healthy.</li>
				<li>Declare a state of emergency and collect necessary medical supplies.</li>
				<li>Provide mail ballot options and protect in-person voting options.</li>
				<li>Provide emergency economic relief to hard hit employees and businesses impacted by quarantines.</li>
			</ul>
